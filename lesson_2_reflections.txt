What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a .git directory with associated files to setup the directory as
a repository.  You need it to setup the commit history setup.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area will have less less files than working directory or repository.  It allows us to add files separately to respository so we can have clearer commits.
